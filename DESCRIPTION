Description: Fast but less flexible version of the \code{missForest} package based on \code{ranger} (a fast implementation of random forests called "random jungle"). Between the iterative model fitting, we offer
    predictive mean matching to add extra variability and to avoid imputation by values not already being present in the data set.
